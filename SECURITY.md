# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In preparation of V1, only the latest version is currently supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You think you found a vulnerability in the library?

We are happy to start the process of coordinated disclosure, please report your findings at [Trout Software Vulnerability Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3OXSSEyYB7h7yeDL3vus8YyTBUP6a_Dm9Q0o6LXyymy3qCA/viewform)

NB: we do not currently run bug bounty programs on our open-source repositories.
Requests for payments will therefore not be accepted.
